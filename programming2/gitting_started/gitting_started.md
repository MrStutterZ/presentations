# What is Git?

* Git is a distributed version control system

--

* Version control systems allow you to track and store changes to files  

--

* You can view the changes you've made in a file's history, and revert them

--

* Distributed version control systems don't rely on a single central repository

--

* This means you can use git anywhere, even if you don't have internet access
