# Summary of "Genetics of single-cell protein abundance variation in large yeast populations"

Albert et al.

---

#Problems with Traditional eQTLs

* Sample size needs to be large

--

* Differences in eQTLs and protein QTLs (pQTLs) have been found

--

* eQTLs with small effect sizes are most likely missed

--

* Authors used extreme QTL mapping (X-QTL)

---

#Methods

* Protein abundance was measured with green fluoresent protein (GFP)

--

* For 174 genes, the authors created crosses with the BY strain that had the GFP, and the RM strain which is genetically divergent.

--

* This created populations that inherited a mixture of both strains genes.

--

* They collected 10,000 cells from each the high and low expression tails

--

* DNA was extracted from each population and sequenced

--

* Allele frequency was calculated and used to find X-pQTLs

---

#Results

* High quality results for 160 genes

--

* Identified 1,025 X-pQTLs FDR=.07

--

* 0-25 X-pQTLs per gene (median=5)

--

* The authors report that their method increases detection of pQTLs by 1,100 percent  

--
* The distribution of number of genes per QTL matches previous studies

---
#Results (cont.)

* The cis-genetic regions came from the BY strain, so X-pQTLs found are distant i.e. trans

--

* Authors investigated cis QTLs by adding GFP to 41 genes in RM strains and recrossing.

--

* ~50% had local X-pQTLs (20 genes)

--

* 60% of distant (trans) eQTLs had an X-pQTL 

--

* Earlier study reported only 23% of eQTLs had pQTL

---
#Results (cont.)

* X-pQTLs corresponding to eQTLs had larger effects

--

* 2/3 of the time X-pQTLs without eQTL agreed with the overall allelic effect direction 

--

* Results support idea of many weak eQTLs

--

* 5 genes with strong cis eQTL had no X-pQTL

--

* Conversely 4 X-pQTLs had no eQTL

---

#Results (cont.)

* It is known that trans eQTLs cluster in hotspots

--

* X-pQTLs had similar clustring

--

* 20 X-pQTL hotspots captured almost all eQTL hotspots

--

* 2 hotspots effected more than half of the genes

--

* Hotspots contained genes like HAP1 and HAP4, which are activators of other genes
